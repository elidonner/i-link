# Evaluation version

This repository contains an evaluation version of **I-Link**, a IO-Link stack
for IO-Link master implementations. It is easy to use and provides a small
footprint. It is especially well suited for embedded systems where resources
are limited and efficiency is crucial. It is written in C and can be run
on bare-metal hardware, an RTOS such as rt-kernel, or on Linux.

It does not contain any ports and cannot be built without adding additional sources.

See [readme](../../README.md) for more information on the complete version of the stack and the [releases](https://github.com/rtlabs-com/i-link/releases)  for binary downloads for common targets.

This version of I-Link can be used for evaluation purposes
only. Contact sales@rt-labs.com if you intend to use this stack in a
product or if you need assistance during evaluation. The commercial
version of this stack is supplied with full sources.
